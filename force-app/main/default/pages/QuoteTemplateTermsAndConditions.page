The place of such arbitration shall be where the principal place of business is of that who is defending the claim or who is the defendant in the action. The judgment of the arbitrator shall be final, non-appealable (to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law) and binding upon the Parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
